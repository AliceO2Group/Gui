# Time server

We are going to build a time server allowing a user to get a remote date.

You will learn:
* how to create a new project using this framework
* how to start it and see it in action
* how to build a web application using [hyperscript](../guide/hyperscript-vnode.md)
* how communication is made between client and server
* how to change the interface
